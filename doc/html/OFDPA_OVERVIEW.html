<h1><a class="anchor" id="OFDPA_OVERVIEW">OF-DPA Software Overview </a></h1><p>OpenFlow Data Plane Abstraction (OF-DPA) is an application software component that implements an adaptation layer between OpenFlow and the Broadcom Silicon SDK. OF-DPA enables scalable implementation of OpenFlow 1.3 on Broadcom switch devices. Figure 1 shows the OF-DPA software component and its relation to other system components. OF-DPA is a part of the OpenNSL library.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1</strong></p></div>
<p> An OpenFlow Controller maintains a channel with each OpenFlow switch, over which it exchanges OpenFlow protocol messages. At the switches, OpenFlow agents maintain their end of the channel, process received OpenFlow protocol messages and send OpenFlow messages in response to local events. OF-DPA fills a key role in this architecture by providing the OF-DPA API to the agent. This API represents hardware tables to the agent in terms of OpenFlow constructs such as flow tables, the group table, and ports. As OF-DPA maintains all of the state that matches the hardware tables to OpenFlow, the agent is expected to do a relatively straightforward and stateless translation of OpenFlow messages into OF-DPA API calls and vice versa. </p>
